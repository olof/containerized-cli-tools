## Inspiration for shell aliases. Probably not something you'd copy wholesale.

# uplot is a command line plotting tool, data visualization
alias uplot='podman run -i --rm youplot'

# if you don't know what npm, you don't need it, spare yourself
alias npm='podman run --rm -ti -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD --entrypoint npm docker.io/node:19-alpine'

# cargo is npm but for rust! â™¥
alias cargo='podman run --rm -ti -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD --entrypoint cargo docker.io/rust:1'

# TODO: both for npm and cargo, i should probably consider investigating
#       how they cache their stuff between projects. but i don't use either
#       that much, so... pull requests?

# Maybe this works? vite without any args will start a server
# on 127.0.0.1:5173. But we want it to be 0.0.0.0:5173, as we're
# otherwise unable to communicate it, while running in the
# container. So we add the --host flags, but only when we think
# the intended action was to start the server. But this is not
# foolproof. Errors related to an invalid --host flag should be
# addressed here as they occur.
vite() {
	case $1 in
		''|-*)
			podman run -p 127.0.0.1:5173:5173 \
			           --rm -ti -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD \
				   vite --host 0.0.0.0 "$@"
			;;
		*)
			shift
			podman run --rm -ti -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD vite build "$@"
			;;
	esac
}

## Inspiration for shell aliases. Probably not something you'd copy wholesale.

# uplot is a command line plotting tool, data visualization
alias uplot='podman run -i --rm youplot'

# if you don't know what npm, you don't need it, spare yourself
# TODO: i should probably consider investigating how npm caches its
#       stuff between projects. but i don't use it that much, so...
#       pull requests?
alias npm='podman run --rm -ti -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD --entrypoint npm docker.io/node:19-alpine'

# cargo is npm but for rust! â™¥
alias cargo='podman run --rm -ti -e HOME --userns keep-id \
                        -v $HOME/.cache/cargo:$HOME/.cargo -e CARGO_HOME= \
			-v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD --entrypoint cargo docker.io/rust:1'


# Maybe this works? vite without any args will start a server
# on 127.0.0.1:5173. But we want it to be 0.0.0.0:5173, as we're
# otherwise unable to communicate it, while running in the
# container. So we add the --host flags, but only when we think
# the intended action was to start the server. But this is not
# foolproof. Errors related to an invalid --host flag should be
# addressed here as they occur. This explains implementing it
# as a function, and not an alias, despite this file's name.
